# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install Node.js (latest LTS version as required by our stack) and ensure npm is available. (Reference: Project Overview > Tech Stack)
2.  Install PostgreSQL client and set up a local PostgreSQL development instance. (Reference: Tech Stack: Database)
3.  Set up AWS CLI and authenticate with your AWS account; verify that you have access to create an S3 bucket in the designated region (e.g., AWS S3 bucket in us-east-1). (Reference: Tech Stack: Cloud Storage)
4.  Create a new Git repository with branches `main` and `dev` in your project directory. (Reference: Internal Setup)
5.  Create a directory structure with at least the following folders: `/frontend`, `/backend`, and `/infra`. (Reference: Internal Structure)
6.  **Validation**: Run `node -v` and `psql --version` to verify installations; confirm Git branches with `git branch`.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize a new React project inside the `/frontend` directory using Lovable.dev’s rapid generation tool. (Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend)
2.  Set up React Router in the project and install required dependencies (e.g., react-router-dom). (Reference: Key Pages & Paths)
3.  Create the Login page component at `/frontend/src/pages/Login.js` with OAuth2.0 authentication hooks. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/login`)
4.  Create the Signup page component at `/frontend/src/pages/Signup.js`. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/signup`)
5.  Create the Dashboard page component at `/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` to display the task list and calendar view. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/dashboard`)
6.  Create the Task Detail page component at `/frontend/src/pages/TaskDetail.js` to show timer and extra task details. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/tasks/:taskId`)
7.  Create the Calendar page component at `/frontend/src/pages/Calendar.js` providing drag-and-drop support. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/calendar`)
8.  Create components for Task creation and editing at `/frontend/src/pages/TaskForm.js` (to be reused for both `/tasks/new` and `/tasks/edit/:taskId`). (Reference: Key Pages & Paths)
9.  Build components for settings and integrations at `/frontend/src/pages/Settings.js` with subdivisions for accessibility (`/settings/accessibility`) and integrations (`/settings/integrations`). (Reference: Key Pages & Paths)
10. Create an Analytics page at `/frontend/src/pages/Analytics.js` to eventually render productivity charts. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths: `/analytics`)
11. Implement task sharing UI components at `/frontend/src/components/TaskShare.js` and calendar sharing at `/frontend/src/components/CalendarShare.js`. (Reference: Key Pages & Paths)
12. Implement a service worker for offline functionality by registering it in `/frontend/src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js`. (Reference: Key Features: Offline Access, Tech Stack: Offline Functionality)
13. Apply design preferences (soothing blues and greens, minimalistic layout, clear fonts) using CSS modules or styled-components; store the style files in `/frontend/src/styles/`. (Reference: Design Preferences)
14. **Validation**: Run the development server with `npm start` in `/frontend` and manually verify that each page route (login, signup, dashboard, etc.) loads correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a new Node.js project in the `/backend` directory and install Express. (Reference: Tech Stack: Backend)
2.  Set up the Express server in `/backend/server.js` with necessary middlewares (CORS, JSON body parser). (Reference: Tech Stack: Backend)
3.  Configure PostgreSQL connection using a configuration file at `/backend/config/db.js` with connection parameters for your local PostgreSQL instance. (Reference: Tech Stack: Database)
4.  Create authentication routes in `/backend/routes/auth.js` including endpoints `POST /login` and `POST /signup` implementing OAuth2.0 flow. (Reference: Key Features: Security & Privacy, Key Pages: `/login` and `/signup`)
5.  Implement task management endpoints (CRUD) in `/backend/routes/tasks.js` to support task creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval. (Reference: Core Features: Task Management)
6.  Develop calendar integration endpoints in `/backend/routes/calendar.js` to handle syncing with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar, including conflict resolution logic. (Reference: Core Features: Calendar Integration)
7.  Create a timer endpoint in `/backend/routes/timer.js` to support task timers and heuristic time estimation. (Reference: Core Features: Task Management; Q&A: Intelligent Time Estimation)
8.  Set up an endpoint for analytics at `/backend/routes/analytics.js` to aggregate productivity and study time data. (Reference: Core Features: Analytics & Insights)
9.  Integrate a basic machine learning heuristic for time estimation in `/backend/services/timeEstimation.js` that can later be replaced with a more advanced ML model. (Reference: Core Features: Task Management, Q&A: Intelligent Time Estimation)
10. **Validation**: Test each endpoint using Postman or cURL (e.g., `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/login` for authentication and similar calls for tasks, calendar, and analytics) to ensure they return the expected responses.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect frontend API calls to backend endpoints by creating an API service file (e.g., `/frontend/src/services/api.js`) using axios or fetch; ensure endpoints such as `/login`, `/tasks`, and `/calendar` are correctly referenced. (Reference: App Flow: Integration of Frontend & Backend)
2.  In the frontend, implement error handling for API calls and integrate OAuth2.0 session persistence. (Reference: Key Features: Security & Privacy, Q&A: Branding)
3.  Implement calendar drag-and-drop support to trigger backend updates via API endpoints in `/frontend/src/services/calendarApi.js`. (Reference: Core Features: Calendar Integration)
4.  Configure CORS in the backend (in `/backend/server.js`) to allow requests from the frontend development server (typically `http://localhost:3000`). (Reference: Integration Details)
5.  Integrate service worker offline functionality by ensuring changes made in offline mode are queued and synced with the backend when the connection is restored. (Reference: Core Features: Offline Access, Q&A: Offline Functionality)
6.  **Validation**: Perform end-to-end testing by simulating API calls from the frontend and ensure successful data synchronization between the frontend UI and backend database.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Set up a production build for the frontend using `npm run build` and confirm the build output is placed in `/frontend/build`. (Reference: Deployment Practices)
2.  Create an AWS S3 bucket (named, for example, `focuscal-static-assets`) in the `us-east-1` region to host the frontend static files. (Reference: Tech Stack: Cloud Storage, Deployment)
3.  Upload the frontend build directory to the AWS S3 bucket and configure CloudFront as the CDN for improved performance. (Reference: Deployment Practices)
4.  Prepare the backend for deployment by configuring environment variables and ensuring the Express server listens on the appropriate port; update `/backend/config/config.js` with production settings. (Reference: Deployment Practices)
5.  Deploy the backend to a cloud provider (such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku) using configuration stored in `/infra/deployment.yaml` (or equivalent). (Reference: Tech Stack: Deployment)
6.  Set up CI/CD pipelines (using GitHub Actions or similar) to automate tests and deployments for both frontend and backend. (Reference: Internal Deployment Guidelines)
7.  **Validation**: Run end-to-end automated tests (using Cypress or similar) against the production URL to ensure that all main features (login, task management, calendar interactions, offline sync) are functioning as expected.

# Additional Considerations

1.  Integrate third-party APIs for Calendar sync (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar) by referencing their publicly available API documentation and secure handling of OAuth tokens. (Reference: Key Features: Calendar Integration, Q&A: Third-Party Integrations)
2.  Add push notification integrations and in-app alerts for deadlines and timer completions; design endpoints or use a third-party service integrated within the backend. (Reference: Key Features: Notifications, Q&A: Notifications)
3.  Implement user settings for accessibility (customizable fonts, colors, dyslexia-friendly options) with persistent storage in the backend and sync with user profiles. (Reference: Core Features: Accessibility & Personalization)
4.  Develop collaboration features such as task and calendar sharing with permission control, including UI components and backend endpoints in `/backend/routes/sharing.js`. (Reference: Core Features: Collaboration & Sharing)
5.  Establish a modular logging and error tracking system in both frontend and backend to enable quick debugging and monitoring in production environments. (Reference: Internal Best Practices)
6.  Document all API endpoints and UI components in a shared project documentation portal to aid future maintenance and onboarding. (Reference: Internal Project Documentation)
7.  **Final Validation**: Conduct full regression testing, including integration with service workers for offline capabilities, ML heuristic functionality, and third-party integrations; gather feedback from a focus group of target users (students with ADHD) to validate the app’s usability and accessibility.
