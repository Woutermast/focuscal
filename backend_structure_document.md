# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The backend of FocusCal is the engine that powers the app. It handles everything from storing user tasks and calendar data to managing integrations with third-party services. In essence, it keeps the app running smoothly, ensuring that students – especially those with ADHD – have a reliable tool to manage their productivity. This document explains how the backend is set up, making it easier for anyone to understand its operation, even without a technical background.

## Backend Architecture

FocusCal’s backend is built on Node.js using the Express framework. This combination is chosen for its simplicity and robustness. The design follows common patterns that help keep the code organized, which means that each part of the backend has a clear job. The system is set up to handle growth; as more students use FocusCal, the structure makes it easy to add new features or improve performance without major disruptions. The architecture supports scalability by allowing components to be updated or replaced with minimal effect on the overall system, and its simplicity contributes to ease of maintenance.

## Database Management

The app uses PostgreSQL as its main database. This is a reliable, SQL-based system where data is neatly organized in tables, which makes it easy to keep track of user tasks, calendar events, and other important information. Data is structured in a way that relates tasks, user profiles, calendar details, and integrations efficiently. Good practices such as indexing, regular backups, and careful query optimization ensure that data is accessed quickly and safely, no matter how much information is stored.

## API Design and Endpoints

The communication between the frontend and backend is handled through a straightforward API design. Most of the endpoints follow RESTful principles, meaning that actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data are done through simple, predictable web addresses. For example, there are specific endpoints for user authentication (like login and signup), managing tasks, syncing with calendars, and pulling analytics data. These endpoints ensure smooth data flow, enabling features such as drag-and-drop task management, calendar synchronization, and real-time notifications. This design makes it easier to integrate with third-party services like Speechify, WordQ, and learning management systems, while also allowing for future expansion with machine learning enhancements for time estimation.

## Hosting Solutions

FocusCal’s backend is hosted in a cloud environment, which offers both reliability and scalability as user demand grows. While not explicitly detailed, the integration with AWS S3 for cloud storage indicates that the project benefits from the robust services available in the cloud. Hosting in this environment means that the app can scale up quickly without major shifts in infrastructure and can be cost-effective by only using resources as needed. Cloud hosting also helps with disaster recovery and automatic backups, ensuring the app remains available at all times.

## Infrastructure Components

Behind the scenes, several infrastructure components ensure that FocusCal runs efficiently. Load balancers are used to distribute incoming user requests across multiple servers, which prevents any single server from being overwhelmed. Caching mechanisms help reduce the load by temporarily storing commonly requested data, which in turn makes the app faster for users. Additionally, a Content Delivery Network (CDN) might be used to serve static assets quickly regardless of the user’s location. All these components work together to improve performance, ensuring that students experience a fast and responsive app every time they use FocusCal.

## Security Measures

Security is a top priority for FocusCal, especially since the app handles sensitive student data. The backend uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication, including support for two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of safety. Data encryption ensures that any data in transit or at rest is protected from unauthorized access. Regular updates and adherence to standards like GDPR and CCPA ensure that privacy and compliance are baked into every part of the system. These measures are designed to keep all user information safe and maintain trust in the app.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep everything running smoothly, FocusCal’s backend is continuously monitored using a suite of tools that track performance, detect errors, and note any unusual activity. Regular maintenance activities, such as software updates and performance tuning, are a key part of the plan. This means that any issues can be quickly resolved, and the system remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and performance improvements. The goal is to minimize downtime and maintain a consistently high level of service for every user.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, FocusCal’s backend is built to be robust, scalable, and secure. It uses Node.js and Express for a clean, manageable structure; PostgreSQL for reliable data management; and RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the frontend and backend. The system is supported by modern hosting solutions, a range of infrastructure components like load balancers and CDNs, and stringent security measures. Every part of the backend works together to support the app’s goal: to help students, particularly those with ADHD, stay organized and manage their time effectively. This careful planning ensures that FocusCal not only meets today’s needs but is also ready to grow and adapt in the future.
