# FocusCal Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

FocusCal is a productivity and calendar management app designed specifically for students, with a special focus on those with ADHD. The application integrates a robust task management system with calendar scheduling, focus tools, and accessibility features to help users plan their study sessions, manage deadlines, and improve overall productivity. By combining detailed task breakdowns, intelligent time tracking, and real-time conflict resolution with external calendars, FocusCal addresses common challenges faced by students needing a structured yet flexible approach to learning and scheduling.

The app is being built to empower students by offering an environment that is both easy to navigate and packed with features that adapt to individual study patterns. Key objectives include enhancing time management through intelligent time estimation (initially using heuristics to later incorporate machine learning), seamless calendar integration using clear prioritization rules, and a customizable interface that can be personalized to accommodate accessibility needs. Success criteria will be measured by improved task completion rates, positive user feedback on ease-of-use and accessibility, and increased engagement across the platform.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   **User Authentication & Profiles**: Secure login/signup using email, Google, and Apple ID with two-factor authentication.
*   **Task Management**: Creation, editing, and categorization of tasks with expansion for detailed views, including traffic light prioritization and an integrated time tracker.
*   **Calendar Integration**: Unified view with drag-and-drop functionality that syncs with external calendars (Google, Apple, etc.), along with conflict resolution based on user-defined rules.
*   **Focus & Productivity Tools**: Pomodoro timer, time blocking features, and task dependencies that trigger notifications upon prerequisite completion.
*   **Accessibility & Personalization**: Customizable UI with adjustable fonts, colors, dyslexia-friendly options, and text-to-speech capabilities.
*   **Collaboration & Sharing**: Ability to share calendars or specific tasks with customizable permissions.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with tools like Speechify, WordQ, and Learning Management Systems (e.g., Moodle, Blackboard) for enhanced study assistance.
*   **Analytics & Insights**: Interactive dashboards providing detailed reports and personalized productivity insights.
*   **Offline Access**: Full local functionality with automatic data synchronization and conflict resolution upon reconnection.
*   **Freemium Model**: Basics available for free with premium subscriptions for advanced analytics and integration features.

### Out-of-Scope

*   **Advanced Machine Learning from Day One**: Initial implementation may start with a heuristic model for time estimation; advanced ML integration for predictive analytics will be planned for future iterations.
*   **Custom Branding Assets**: While design inspiration is drawn from Apple and Google calendars, custom logos, detailed style guides, and advanced branding will be created in a subsequent design phase.
*   **Exotic or Niche Integrations**: Focus will be on popular external calendars, mainstream LMS systems, and widely-used third-party study tools. Additional integrations may be considered post-launch.
*   **Complex Monetization Strategies Beyond Freemium**: In-depth monetization analytics, upselling strategies, or advertisement integrations are excluded from the initial release.

## 3. User Flow

A new user begins their journey with a smooth, intuitive onboarding process. They arrive at a clean sign-up or login page where they can register using their email or through social login options like Google or Apple ID. Once authenticated—and optionally secured with two-factor authentication—they are directed to a unified dashboard. Here, the user sees two main sections: a left pane displaying a sortable list of tasks (with clear categorization and priority markers) and a right pane showcasing a dynamic calendar view integrated with external calendars. Notifications, reminders, and alerts prompt them about task deadlines and upcoming focus sessions.

After the initial setup, the user easily navigates through various sections. They can click on a task to open a detailed view where additional information like objectives, deadlines, and study materials is accessible. The focus timer feature prompts them to battle procrastination by tracking actual time spent (with breaks managed through pausing/resuming options). Drag-and-drop functionality allows tasks to be rescheduled effortlessly within the calendar, and when prerequisite (dependent) tasks are marked as complete, notifications alert the user to move forward with subsequent tasks. Throughout this flow, accessible settings are available to customize the look and feel, ensuring the app is easy to use for every student, regardless of their cognitive needs.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints**

    *   The initial time estimation feature will begin with a basic heuristic model before advancing to machine learning.
    *   All integrations rely on public API documentation; early coordination with third-party providers is essential.
    *   Offline data synchronization must handle potential conflicts gracefully via timestamp-based resolution.
    *   The freemium model may restrict advanced analytics and integrations to paying users.

*   **Assumptions**

    *   Users have or will adopt digital calendars (Google, Apple, etc.) for effective integration.
    *   There is a consistent availability of internet connectivity, though offline functionality is supported.
    *   The target audience (students, particularly with ADHD) will appreciate and adopt accessibility features and customizable options.
    *   Third-party tools like Speechify and WordQ provide stable API access and clear integration guidelines.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Third-Party Restrictions**

    *   Potential rate limits from external calendar, Speechify, or LMS APIs may affect data synchronization.
    *   Mitigation: Implement caching strategies and exponential back-off for retries.

*   **Data Synchronization Conflicts**

    *   Conflicts may occur between local changes and cloud data during offline usage.
    *   Mitigation: Use timestamp-based conflict resolution and prompt the user when manual intervention is needed.

*   **Machine Learning Integration**

    *   Transitioning from a heuristic model to an advanced ML approach may require significant data collection and model tuning.
    *   Mitigation: Roll out the heuristic model first, then incrementally introduce ML enhancements based on user data and validated predictions.

*   **User Interface Complexity**

    *   Balancing advanced features with an intuitive use for students with ADHD may lead to potential usability challenges.
    *   Mitigation: Employ user testing sessions and iterative design improvements to ensure clarity and simplicity.

*   **Monetization Impact**

    *   The freemium model may create discrepancies in user experience between free and premium users.
    *   Mitigation: Clearly delineate premium features while ensuring core functionality remains robust and attractive in the free version.
