# FocusCal App Flow Document

## Introduction

FocusCal is a productivity and calendar management app created especially for students and those with ADHD. The app helps users manage their tasks, study schedules, and deadlines by combining a smart task list with a dynamic calendar. It provides focus tools like the Pomodoro timer, time blocking, and intelligent task time estimation that learns from past performance to predict future needs. The overall goal of FocusCal is to offer a distraction-free, intuitive experience that helps users stay organized and improve productivity while adapting to individual study habits.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first accesses FocusCal, they are greeted by a clean and inviting onboarding screen that introduces the app’s goals and features. The initial experience directs users to either sign in or sign up. During sign-up, users can create an account using their email address or through social login options like Google or Apple ID. The registration process is secure and may include two-factor authentication for added safety. For returning users, the login page provides a simple, secure sign-in form. If a user forgets their password, a clear ‘forgot password’ link guides them through the recovery process. Once authentication is complete, users are seamlessly directed to the main dashboard to begin their productivity journey.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, users are taken to the unified dashboard, which acts as the central hub of FocusCal. The dashboard displays a split interface with a left pane showing a detailed list of tasks and a right pane featuring the visual calendar. This layout offers an immediate overview of upcoming deadlines, scheduled tasks, and focus sessions. Users can view and interact with tasks, add new ones, and see tasks integrated into the calendar. The intuitive design ensures that moving between the list, the calendar, and other parts of the app is effortless, making it clear how to access any feature seamlessly from the main page.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the main dashboard, users can dive into specific features. When a task is created or clicked, it expands into a detailed view where users can see objectives, learning materials like videos, quizzes, and deadlines. A built-in timer prompts users to start tracking time for the task, and an integrated overlay appears with options such as the Pomodoro and time blocking tools. This overlay manages breaks, letting users pause and resume as they work. Users can drag and drop tasks between the list and the calendar, and if a task is mistakenly placed, it can be removed from the calendar without being deleted from the task list. The calendar view also seamlessly synchronizes with external platforms such as Google and Apple Calendar. When overlapping events occur, the system flags these conflicts and either suggests automatic reassignment based on duration estimates and user preferences or lets the user manually adjust the time slots. Additionally, the app supports task dependencies by notifying users when a prerequisite task has been completed, ensuring a smooth progression through multiple tasks. Other integrated pages include analytics dashboards where users can review charts and insights about their productivity trends, settings pages for accessibility and third-party integrations, and collaboration pages where they can share calendars or task details with peers and teachers. Each page and feature is interconnected, so transitioning from one module to another is designed to be natural and intuitive, with clear navigation options embedded within the user interface.

## Settings and Account Management

FocusCal provides a dedicated settings area where users can manage their personal details, update preferences, and configure notifications. In the profile section, users can update contact information and set up two-factor authentication. The application also features specific settings pages where users can customize the look and feel of the interface, such as adjusting color schemes, fonts, and accessibility features like text-to-speech or dyslexia-friendly options. There are also integration settings where users can connect third-party tools like Speechify, WordQ, and Learning Management Systems for a richer study experience. From the settings area, it is easy to navigate back to the main dashboard, ensuring the overall user journey remains consistent and streamlined throughout the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

FocusCal is designed to handle common errors and alternate scenarios gracefully. If a user enters invalid data when signing up or logging in, clear error messages are displayed to guide them on how to correct the information before resubmitting. In cases of lost internet connectivity, the app maintains full offline functionality by using local caching and service workers, allowing users to continue working and automatically synchronizing changes once connectivity is restored. When scheduling conflicts occur, such as overlapping tasks or calendar events, the app immediately flags these issues with notifications and provides options for manual override or automatic reassignment. Clear communication through in-app alerts ensures that even if a user takes an action that is restricted or invalid, they are promptly informed of the next steps to recover normal flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey through FocusCal starts with a smooth introduction that leads users from a friendly onboarding process, through secure authentication, and then to a clean, organized dashboard where tasks and calendar events coexist. Users are empowered to create detailed tasks, track focus with built-in timers, and integrate with external calendars effortlessly. The app further supports customization through robust settings for accessibility and third-party integrations. In case of errors or conflicts, appropriate messages ensure that users always know how to regain control. Overall, FocusCal offers a comprehensive and interconnected experience that empowers students to manage their time and productivity in a secure, user-friendly, and adaptive environment, making every step from sign-up to task completion clear and intuitive.
